# Travel-on-the-ICD-Tree

## Project Overview

International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding serves as a pivotal standard for medical data governance, underpinning hospital performance assessment, health insurance reimbursement, and clinical research. In practice, clinical coders must engage in logical reasoning and rule verification within the complex ICD hierarchical tree.

This study introduces the Travel on the ICD Tree framework, which conceptualizes the ICD coding task as a structured exploration process within the ICD hierarchy. It incorporates an agent-based workflow that combines similarity-based retrieval with hierarchical navigation to equip the model with ICD coding rule information.
